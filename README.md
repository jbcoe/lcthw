Learning C the hard way using Zed Shaw's [alpha book release](c.learncodethehardway.org/book/). 

I need to take notes on paper and go over things in more detail, so I can remember concepts like pointers, linked lists 
and other data structures particular to C languages.    

Reading [Think like a programmer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Like-Programmer-Introduction-Creative/dp/1593274246)
alongside it, but need to concentrate on one of them as _Think like a programmer_ is C++ based.

P.S. also experementing with markdown.
