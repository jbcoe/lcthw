## Learn C the hard way

Learning C the hard way using Zed Shaw's [alpha book release](c.learncodethehardway.org/book/). 

I need to take notes on paper and go over things in more detail, so I can remember concepts like pointers, structs and other data structures particular to C language.

Reading [Think like a programmer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Like-Programmer-Introduction-Creative/dp/1593274246)
alongside it, but need to concentrate on one of them as _Think like a programmer_ is C++ based. 

Things I learnt:
 * passing by reference can be more efficient
 * structs can be packed for more efficient memory
